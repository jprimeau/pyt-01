# Write a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of 
# alternating '1s' and '0s'.
#  - The string should start with a 1.
#  - A string with size 6 should return :'101010'.
#  - With size 4 should return : '1010'.
#  - With size 12 should return : '101010101010'.
# The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.

def stringy(size):
    pass # Good luck! :-)
