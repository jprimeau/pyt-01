# Write a function that takes an amount and calculates the taxes and total.
# The function must return a dictionnary containing amount, gst, qst and total.
# For example:
#  taxes(1.00) would return:
#   {'amount': '1.00$', 'total': '1.15$', 'gst': '0.05$', 'qst': '0.10$'} 
#  - GST is currently at 5%
#  - QST is currently 9.9975%
# The amount will always be positive and will only use int or float.

def taxes(amount):
    pass # Good luck! :-)
