# In a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (n > 0 given) a friend of mine has 
# removed two numbers but it tells me that the product of the two removed 
# numbers is equal to the sum of the numbers he left in the sequence.
# Sometimes he cheats and it's not true.
# Could you tell me what the removed numbers a and b are?
# The function takes the parameter: n (don't worry: n is always strictly 
# greater than 0 and small enough so we shouldn't have overflow) and returns 
# an array of the form
# [(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...}
# with all (a, b) which are the possible removed numbers in the sequence 1 to n.
# [ (a, b), ...] or [ [a, b], ...] or { {a, b}, ...} will be sorted in 
# increasing order of the "a".
# It happens that there are several (a, b). The function returns an empty 
# array if no possible numbers are found which will prove that my friend has 
# cheated!
# Examples:
#  - removeNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]
#  - removeNb(100) should return []

def removeNb(n):
	pass # Good luck! :-)
