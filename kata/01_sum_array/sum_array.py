# Write a function sum_array that takes an array of numbers and returns the 
# sum of the numbers. These may be integers or decimals. The numbers can also 
# be negative. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should 
# return 0.
# Examples:
#  - sum_array([1 2 3]) --> 6
#  - sum_array([]) --> 0
# You can assume that you are only given numbers.
# You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empsty, return 0.

def sum_array(a):
    pass # Good luck :-)
